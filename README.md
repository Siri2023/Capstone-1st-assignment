# World Energy Consumption
## Introduction
The World Energy Consumption dataset contains information about the total energy consumption across various regions and countries in the world. The dataset is compiled from various sources such as the International Energy Agency and the World Bank, and covers a time period from 1960 to 2018.
## Objective
The dataset aims to facilitate research and analysis of global energy consumption trends over time, and enable the development of data-driven solutions to promote sustainable energy consumption patterns and mitigate climate change.

The dataset includes information on both renewable and non-renewable energy sources, covering a time period from 1960 to 2018, and includes data from different countries and regions. The objective of the dataset is to provide a broad and diverse set of data that can be used to answer a wide range of research questions related to energy consumption patterns.

By making this dataset available, the authors hope to encourage research and analysis on global energy consumption patterns, and facilitate the development of effective policies and strategies to promote sustainable energy consumption and mitigate climate change.
